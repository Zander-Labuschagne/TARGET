# TARGET - Thrustmaster Advanced pRogramming Graphical EdiTor

Thrustmaster T.A.R.G.E.T. for Sublime Text 3.

## Features:
* Syntax highlighting that is in my opinion an improvement over the proprietary editor, let me know if you don't agree.
* Code completion using snippets that includes hints to help non-programmers their way around the language. Let me know if the hints/completions are a little too much.

*PS: This is my first editor plugin/addon/package*
